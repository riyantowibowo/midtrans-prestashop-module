Feel free to change code if needed to customize the module.
If you want to hide Midtrans logo or change any wordings, the frontend files are located here:
* Payment list: `/views/templates/hook/payment.tpl`
* Payment confirmation: `/views/templates/front/payment_execution.tpl`
* Payment page with popup: `/views/templates/front/snappay.tpl`

For example, if you want to remove logo, just search for `Midtrans.png` within those files or change the logo directly at `/logo/` folder.

#### Separated Payment Buttons
If you do not prefer just 1 single payment button/options ("Online Payments") displayed to your customer, you can enable:
`Enable Separated Bank Transfer Button` from the module configuration menu. It will allow you display additional separated payment buttons like:
